Blud
================================================================================

Blud is an open ended RPG in which the player controls a red blood cell named
Blud. Blud lives in a small town named Ticker Town. Throughout the game Blud
must reach various goals that will open new areas and new goals to accomplish.

Story
================================================================================

The story starts out with:

	There was once a young blood cell named Blud, but everyone called him... uh
	they called him... Quick, player, what did they call him?

        [         ]
        A B C D E F G H I J K
        L M N O P Q R S T U V
        W X Y Z - . , ! ` & '
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

        [ Okay ]

Every time the player meets a new NPC they introduce themselves as "Hi, I'm Blud
but all my friends call me Steve" or "The name is Blud, but you can call me
Hank", etc.

The player is introduced to his farm on the outskirts of Ticker Town, and then
it is slowly revealed to the player that the various organs (towns) are all
suffering from a lack of oxygen. In fact the heart (Ticker Town) is not not
working very well at the moment, so the river that is used as a highway between
towns is a mere trickle at the moment.

The player then learns that they can take a ferry on the river to the Oxygen
mines where they can obtain oxygen (basically think of oxygen as coal...) Taking
oxygen back to Ticker Town will let them replenish it until it is working better
and the flow of the river increases some, which then allows access to another
town.

Each town they encounter will need an oxygen gauge to be filled to restore it to
full function. Simply going back and forth between the lungs and other towns is
not sufficient though. Each new town will be progressively harder and require
some new tool or ability to complete.

The oxygen mines will also be a hazardous place. The player will learn there
that the host body had been drowning. The lungs are full of water in many places
and there are many dangerous creatures (viruses that have been breathed in).


Ticker Town
================================================================================

The majority of the town is centered around a valley at the base of a large dam
made out of cholesterol. A blood plasma river is slowed by the dam forming a
large lake on the west side of town. The river then continues to flow east.

Landmarks in the town:

	- The river

		The river is made up of blood plasma. It should be drawn as soupy
		pinkish blue cells. A dock on the river is used with ferries that can be
		used to take the player to other organs throughout the host's body.
	- The dam

		One of the long term goals of the game is to open up the dam to let the
		river flow stronger. Initially the flow is only sufficient to take the
		player to the lungs, where they can obtain oxygen.

		Bringing oxygen to the various organs will improve their function. Some
		require a small amount that can be taken easily by the character and
		others will require a large amount to unlock the organ/town.

	- Telegraph station

		Allows communication with the various other organs/towns. Used for
		obtaining quests, etc. Should be drawn to appear like the lines are
		nerves.

	- Farm

		The player's home is on a large fairly open section of the game map and
		the player is allowed to build things there including some sort of farm
		similar to Harvest Moon with worms as livestock, and some sort of fungus
		or bacteria as "plants".

		The player must grow various crops and obtain and take care of livestock
		in order to obtain different items needed to complete quests that will
		allow them to unlock new areas and tools in the game.

		Other items may be found or foraged in various parts of the game, or
		awarded for completing difficult quests. In some cases this may mean a
		zelda like dungeon, while in others it will be collecting items or
		through interacting with NPCs.

		Finally the farm provides a good way for the player to gain currency.
