Blud
================================================================================

Blud is an open ended RPG in which the player controls a red blood cell named
Blud. Blud lives in a small town named Ticker Town. Throughout the game Blud
must reach various goals that will open new areas and new goals to accomplish.

Story
================================================================================

The story starts out with:

	There was once a young blood cell named Blud, but everyone called him... uh
	they called him... Quick, player, what did they call him?

        [         ]
        A B C D E F G H I J K
        L M N O P Q R S T U V
        W X Y Z - . , ! ` & '
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

        [ Okay ]

Every time the player meets a new NPC they introduce themselves as "Hi, I'm Blud
but all my friends call me Steve" or "The name is Blud, but you can call me
Hank", etc.

The player is introduced to his farm on the outskirts of Ticker Town, and then
it is slowly revealed to the player that the various organs (towns) are all
suffering from a lack of oxygen. In fact the heart (Ticker Town) is not not
working very well at the moment, so the river that is used as a highway between
towns is a mere trickle at the moment.

The player then learns that they can take a ferry on the river to the Oxygen
mines where they can obtain oxygen (basically think of oxygen as coal...) Taking
oxygen back to Ticker Town will let them replenish it until it is working better
and the flow of the river increases some, which then allows access to another
town.

Each town they encounter will need an oxygen gauge to be filled to restore it to
full function. Simply going back and forth between the lungs and other towns is
not sufficient though. Each new town will be progressively harder and require
some new tool or ability to complete.

The oxygen mines will also be a hazardous place. The player will learn there
that the host body had been drowning. The lungs are full of water in many places
and there are many dangerous creatures (viruses that have been breathed in).


Ticker Town
================================================================================

The majority of the town is centered around a valley at the base of a large dam
made out of cholesterol. A blood plasma river is slowed by the dam forming a
large lake on the west side of town. The river then continues to flow east.

Landmarks in the town:

	- The river

		The river is made up of blood plasma. It should be drawn as soupy
		pinkish blue cells. A dock on the river is used with ferries that can be
		used to take the player to other organs throughout the host's body.

	- The dam

		One of the long term goals of the game is to open up the dam to let the
		river flow stronger. Initially the flow is only sufficient to take the
		player to the lungs, where they can obtain oxygen.

		Bringing oxygen to the various organs will improve their function. Some
		require a small amount that can be taken easily by the character and
		others will require a large amount to unlock the organ/town.

	- Telegraph station

		Allows communication with the various other organs/towns. Used for
		obtaining quests, etc. Should be drawn to appear like the lines are
		nerves.

	- Farm

		The player's home is on a large fairly open section of the game map and
		the player is allowed to build things there including some sort of farm
		similar to Harvest Moon with worms as livestock, and some sort of fungus
		or bacteria as "plants".

		The player must grow various crops and obtain and take care of livestock
		in order to obtain different items needed to complete quests that will
		allow them to unlock new areas and tools in the game.

		Other items may be found or foraged in various parts of the game, or
		awarded for completing difficult quests. In some cases this may mean a
		zelda like dungeon, while in others it will be collecting items or
		through interacting with NPCs.

		Finally the farm provides a good way for the player to gain currency.

Organs/Towns/Dungeons
================================================================================

Each organ will be either a dungeon, a town, or in many cases a combination of
the two.

Each organ must follow these rules:

1) Getting to the organ must require an effort. In some cases this may be small.
In other cases getting to the organ may require a tool or some item that is
obtained somewhere else in the game.

2) Each organ must provide a final prize. This may be a tool or new ability, or
status with an NPC, etc, but whatever it is getting it must open gameplay paths
to the user that were previously visible but closed. The obvious example is
showing the user paths or items stuck behind an object they can't move, and then
giving them a tool to move that object as a prize.

3) Each organ must be solvable in multiple ways. One involving combat, and the
other involving farming/items/dialog with NPCs.

In each case one of these paths should be more obvious and significantly easier
than the other, but both need to be present. The intent is to allow a non-combat
or non-farming run of the entire game. This also provides an alternative route
if a user feels stuck with the main route.

It should be clear to the user which method is the intended way to solve it
though.

For example, the normal route for an organ may be to fight a new virus that is
more challenging than previous enemies. If a user wants to avoid combat though
or finds this fight too difficult then talking to a particular NPC will reveal
that he is willing to fight them for you but will only do so if you give him a
VERY hard to obtain item.


Progression
================================================================================

Blud will start out with very limited abilities and must unlock various new
abilities by obtaining items. These items will unlock new areas, and allow
progression through the game.

Some of these items will also be weapons that can be used in combat against
viruses. Access to some areas will require wiping out large numbers of viruses
in order to cure the host of a viral infection. Access to some parts of the
host's body will not be possible until these infections have been cursed.

Blud will also be able to start a farm (or some analogous concept) where items
can be planted and tended until ready to pick, and livestock (viruses for which
the host has been vaccinated?) in order to obtain various resources.

Resources may also be collected in specific places, such as oxygen in the
oxygen mines (lungs). Access to some areas, may require the collection of a
large amount of specific resources.

It may be possible for the player to kill all of the viruses that are part of
the infections (but maybe not because they will reproduce) and to collect all
of the required resources, but doing so would take a ridiculous amount of time.

So, instead, once Blud has gained an ability, and recruited another blood cell
to help that blud cell can be taught that ability.

Recruiting will require finding a blood cell that likes Blud a great deal. Early
on this will mean spending a lot of time helping individual blood cells. As Blud
helps in a particular organ all of the blood cells living in that organ will
become easier and easier to recruit.

Each blood cell can be recruited for a single task. Prior to being recruited
each cell (without specific hand written quests) will have randomly generated
quests that can be done to make that cell like you more.

Possible tasks that cells can be recruited for:
	- Defense of an organ (fighting infection).
	- Mining
	- Farming
