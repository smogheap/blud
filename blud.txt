Blud
================================================================================

Blud is an open ended RPG in which the player controls a red blood cell named
Blud. Blud lives in a small town named Ticker Town. Throughout the game Blud
must reach various goals that will open new areas and new goals to accomplish.

Story
================================================================================

The story starts out with:

	There was once a young blood cell named Blud, but everyone called him... uh
	they called him... Quick, player, what did they call him?

        [         ]
        A B C D E F G H I J K
        L M N O P Q R S T U V
        W X Y Z - . , ! ` & '
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

        [ Okay ]

Every time the player meets a new NPC they introduce themselves as "Hi, I'm Blud
but all my friends call me Steve" or "The name is Blud, but you can call me
Hank", etc.

The player is introduced to his farm on the outskirts of Ticker Town, and then
it is slowly revealed to the player that the various organs (towns) are all
suffering from a lack of oxygen. In fact the heart (Ticker Town) is not not
working very well at the moment, so the river that is used as a highway between
towns is a mere trickle at the moment.

The player then learns that they can take a ferry on the river to the Oxygen
mines where they can obtain oxygen (basically think of oxygen as coal...) Taking
oxygen back to Ticker Town will let them replenish it until it is working better
and the flow of the river increases some, which then allows access to another
town.

Each town they encounter will need an oxygen gauge to be filled to restore it to
full function. Simply going back and forth between the lungs and other towns is
not sufficient though. Each new town will be progressively harder and require
some new tool or ability to complete.

The oxygen mines will also be a hazardous place. The player will learn there
that the host body had been drowning. The lungs are full of water in many places
and there are many dangerous creatures (viruses that have been breathed in).


Ticker Town
================================================================================

The majority of the town is centered around a valley at the base of a large dam
made out of cholesterol. A blood plasma river is slowed by the dam forming a
large lake on the west side of town. The river then continues to flow east.

Landmarks in the town:

	- The river

		The river is made up of blood plasma. It should be drawn as soupy
		pinkish blue cells. A dock on the river is used with ferries that can be
		used to take the player to other organs throughout the host's body.

	- The dam

		One of the long term goals of the game is to open up the dam to let the
		river flow stronger. Initially the flow is only sufficient to take the
		player to the lungs, where they can obtain oxygen.

		Bringing oxygen to the various organs will improve their function. Some
		require a small amount that can be taken easily by the character and
		others will require a large amount to unlock the organ/town.

	- Telegraph station

		Allows communication with the various other organs/towns. Used for
		obtaining quests, etc. Should be drawn to appear like the lines are
		nerves.

	- Farm

		The player's home is on a large fairly open section of the game map and
		the player is allowed to build things there including some sort of farm
		similar to Harvest Moon with worms as livestock, and some sort of fungus
		or bacteria as "plants".

		The player must grow various crops and obtain and take care of livestock
		in order to obtain different items needed to complete quests that will
		allow them to unlock new areas and tools in the game.

		Other items may be found or foraged in various parts of the game, or
		awarded for completing difficult quests. In some cases this may mean a
		zelda like dungeon, while in others it will be collecting items or
		through interacting with NPCs.

		Finally the farm provides a good way for the player to gain currency.

Organs/Towns/Dungeons
================================================================================

Each organ will be either a dungeon, a town, or in many cases a combination of
the two.

Each organ must follow these rules:

1) Getting to the organ must require an effort. In some cases this may be small.
In other cases getting to the organ may require a tool or some item that is
obtained somewhere else in the game.

2) Each organ must provide a final prize. This may be a tool or new ability, or
status with an NPC, etc, but whatever it is getting it must open gameplay paths
to the user that were previously visible but closed. The obvious example is
showing the user paths or items stuck behind an object they can't move, and then
giving them a tool to move that object as a prize.

3) Each organ must be solvable in multiple ways. One involving combat, and the
other involving farming/items/dialog with NPCs.

In each case one of these paths should be more obvious and significantly easier
than the other, but both need to be present. The intent is to allow a non-combat
or non-farming run of the entire game. This also provides an alternative route
if a user feels stuck with the main route.

It should be clear to the user which method is the intended way to solve it
though.

For example, the normal route for an organ may be to fight a new virus that is
more challenging than previous enemies. If a user wants to avoid combat though
or finds this fight too difficult then talking to a particular NPC will reveal
that he is willing to fight them for you but will only do so if you give him a
VERY hard to obtain item.


Progression
================================================================================

Blud will start out with very limited abilities and must unlock various new
abilities by obtaining items. These items will unlock new areas, and allow
progression through the game.

Some of these items will also be weapons that can be used in combat against
viruses. Access to some areas will require wiping out large numbers of viruses
in order to cure the host of a viral infection. Access to some parts of the
host's body will not be possible until these infections have been cursed.

Blud will also be able to start a farm (or some analogous concept) where items
can be planted and tended until ready to pick, and livestock (viruses for which
the host has been vaccinated?) in order to obtain various resources.

Resources may also be collected in specific places, such as oxygen in the
oxygen mines (lungs). Access to some areas, may require the collection of a
large amount of specific resources.

It may be possible for the player to kill all of the viruses that are part of
the infections (but maybe not because they will reproduce) and to collect all
of the required resources, but doing so would take a ridiculous amount of time.

So, instead, once Blud has gained an ability, and recruited another blood cell
to help that blud cell can be taught that ability.

Recruiting will require finding a blood cell that likes Blud a great deal. Early
on this will mean spending a lot of time helping individual blood cells. As Blud
helps in a particular organ all of the blood cells living in that organ will
become easier and easier to recruit.

Each blood cell can be recruited for a single task. Prior to being recruited
each cell (without specific hand written quests) will have randomly generated
quests that can be done to make that cell like you more.

Possible tasks that cells can be recruited for:
	- Defense of an organ (fighting infection).
	- Mining
	- Farming


Virus vs Immune System
================================================================================

A newer idea (which may conflict with some things above) is to have 2 factions
that the player can side with. One is the host body's immune system, and the
other is a virus or parasite of some sort.

The virus' ultimate goal is to take control over the body and will result in the
host body surviving but not in control of itself. The player will be given a
choice of supporting the virus (which will probably be easier in the end) or
helping the immune system and fighting the virus. Either of these outcomes will
result in a (reasonably) health host body but it should be made clear to the
player than if the virus is present but doesn't actually take control that the
host body will be killed.

Early in the game the player will be a fairly neutral area, and will have a
chance to meet many NPCs from both sides of this dispute, including some that
appear to be on one side but are secretly helping the other.

Various NPCs will give the player quests that encourage them to help their side
or hurt their opponents side. In some cases these quests will raise the player's
standing with the side that gave the quest and in others it will lower their
standing with the other side. The player must carefully choose which of these
quests to do and how to do them. For example, a quest may encourage the player
to sabotage the other side in some way, and if done without being discovered it
will raise standing with one side but not damage it with the other.

The player's standing with each side should somehow be communicated to the
player. Ideally not with a number or a bar, but there should be a mechanism to
convey to the player how each side feels about them. This may simply be
expressed in dialogs with NPCs.

The player may make a choice early on and strongly support one side from the
start. This will result in a much higher standing with that side than the player
would have if they walked the line for a long time.

Eventually the player will need to trigger one side becoming hostile in order to
proceed. This can be delayed for a very long time by keeping the standing of the
sides roughly equivalent. An enemy of my enemy is my friend after all. It will
likely be impossible to cause both sides to be hostile towards you since this
would make the story impossible to complete.

The player will have the opportunity (through dialogs, quests and other in game
details) to discover the stated motives of each side, and with enough digging to
discover the true motives of both sides. Discovering the true motives will give
the player a chance to avoid being betrayed or used as a pawn.

A player who quickly picks a side and strongly supports that side will be
unlikely or unable to discover these motives and will likely be betrayed
resulting in a final outcome that is very different from what they had intended.

// TODO Start coming up with lore and terminology for how these cells view this
//		war. The viruses probably don't refer to themselves as viruses and the
//		immune system doesn't refer to themselves as such.
//
//		This should include basic history of the groups, their leadership, etc
//
//		This should also include a great deal of focus on the propaganda that
//		each side uses to try to push their view. There will be many areas that
//		are infected to various degrees with actual fighting going on but they
//		use non-violent means to try to sway each other as well.


DNA
================================================================================

Blud's health is displayed as a bar full of DNA. DNA is used as a catch all item
in the game, where other games would have multiple different mechanisms. When an
enemy is killed they will usually drop a small item with a DNA icon. Walking
near this will automatically pick it up, and increase a DNA counter for the
player.

The DNA counter can be used for:
	Healing
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Healing using DNA will take a fixed amount from the DNA counter and add it
	to the player's health bar. This takes a fixed amount of time and during
	this time the player can not move and is vulnerable.

	A player may also purchase consumable healing items which are not lost if
	the player dies (since regular DNA is).


	Upgrades
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Upgrades are basically a very simple leveling system, which uses DNA as most
	games would use XP.

	Upgrades may include things like increasing the size of the health bar,
	being able to do more damage when attacking, being able to heal faster, etc.

	These will generally be fairly expensive.

	If a player attempts to purchase an upgrade that they can't yet afford the
	merchant will give them the opportunity to make a partial payment. Doing so
	will take the DNA from the player right away and reduce the price of the
	upgrade by that amount.



	Items
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Items may include various consumables (healing item, cures, items that cause
	a temporary effect, etc) as well as various single use items such as keys
	for specific doors or key items needed for NPC quest lines.

	As with upgrades, a player can pay part of the cost of any single use item
	to reduce the price by that amount.


When the player dies all currently held DNA is dropped with the player's corpse.
The player then starts over with a new cell at full health, and if the player
can get back to their corpse then they can pick up the DNA that they dropped
when they died.

Dying multiple times will not remove any dropped DNA from the world, but dropped
DNA will slowly degrade so a player will be motivated to pick it back up quickly
when dropped.

Dying multiple times will increase the rate at which DNA from previous deaths
decays.

Rough Ideas
================================================================================

Town names:
- Kidney Pass
- PAИCЯEДS (communist place complete with crumbled wall)
- Little Lymph
- Stomach Valley
- Fort Spleen
- Sinus Trail
- Thyroid Heights
- New Liver
- Cape Esophagus
- Gallbladder Gulch
- Pineal Grand
- Mt Adrenal
- Tonsil Township
- St Diaphragm
- Las Vericose

Trophies:
- I'm a lover, not a fighter: finish the game with no combat
- Bludy mess: finish the game with no farming
- Rebel: always do things the hard way



Enemies
================================================================================

Main character has NO weapons. All combat is done by learning enemy behavior and
using enemies against themselves and each other. The player may obtain items
that are defensive and can indirectly be used as weapons, such as some sort of
shield that reflects attacks, etc.

- Small spiny guy that rushes towards you, and will kill himself if he hits a
wall

- Snake that starts out 3 or 4 squares long. It moves by bunching up it's tail
and then ripples that movement through it's body to telegraph an upcoming lunge.

If it lunges forward and an enemy is in the way then it will devour it and grow
longer. Growing longer will slow it down, and eventually allow you to trick it
into crashing into itself which will kill it.
