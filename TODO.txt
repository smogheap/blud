- Create a tile class that defines each tile, including logic for finding an
alternate tile based on borders for those that support it like plasma/water and
animations for tiles like the doors.

- Better split the actor class so that player extends it as does each badguy,
and the NPCs etc.
	- Create an editor actor class that renders a square on the screen to show
	the spot a tile will go. This actor only displays in edit mode and handles
	movement of the cursor, etc. When exiting edit mode the player should be
	warped to its position if the spot is empty.

- Draw a square around the tile that blud is facing when in editor mode
- Make blud move twice as fast in editor mode
- Allow changing the selected tile in editor mode by pressing one of the 4 face
buttons. Long press on a face button to swap the tile assigned to it.
