- Create a tile class that defines each tile, including logic for finding an
alternate tile based on borders for those that support it like plasma/water and
animations for tiles like the doors.

- Better split the actor class so that player extends it as does each badguy,
and the NPCs etc.

- Draw a square around the tile that blud is facing when in editor mode
- Make blud move twice as fast in editor mode
- Allow changing the selected tile in editor mode by pressing one of the 4 face
buttons. Long press on a face button to swap the tile assigned to it.
